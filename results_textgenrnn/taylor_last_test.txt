Butto paint them my favorite song
Stay, stay
I'm feeling like I'm wonderstruck
Every little piece love
People throw rocks at things that shine
Oh my my my my
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
Say you'll see me again
But what can I say?
Let the games begin
(Ey, ey, ey, ey, ey)
The feeling so Gatsby for that whole yeah

We are never, ever, ever getting back together
I stand up with shaking people change and these days little brought his change away and you said, "Yes"
Don't wanna hurt you, I just wanna be alone
Then it made you come back down
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life
I see you turn off your phone
You heard about me, ooh
