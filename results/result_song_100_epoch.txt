indow
when we're on the phone and he talks real slow
'cause it's late and his mama don't know
our song is the way he laughs
the first date: "man, i didn't kiss him, and i should have"
and when i got home 'fore i said amen
asking god if he could play it again
play it again
i was riding shotgun with my hair undone
in the front seat of his car
i grabbed a pen and an old napkin
and i wrote down our song

friday night beneath the stars
in a field behind your yard
you and i are painting pictures in the sky
and sometimes we don't say a thing
just lesten to the crickets sing
everything i need is rogccnh
if wou tay i hot to a iare oo fas bpeat
and i rocd lasbhd and you hete that feep mffht of kust an
